    """
    Retrieves a specific logger with fixed configuration.
    The philosophy behind logging is explained in https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html
    To avoid a bit of boiler place code and setup, this method
    creates the requested logger to log WARNINGs and above to the console and
    additionally everything from DEBUG up to a file.
    It is still recommended to create one logger per module once at the top
    and also to set the level parameter from a config file; see parameter
    documentation for details.

    name: name of the logger. This can be omitted and will default to the name
            of the calling module or "root", if called from the main module.
    file: the file messages with DEBUG and above level are logged to.
            Defaults to ts3bot.log
    level: the global level for the logger. While two handlers exist for
            printing to console and to file with their own level,
            the logger itself can be set to a certain log level (default: DEBUG)
            which can disable messages before reaching the respective handler,
            see https://docs.python.org/3/_images/logging_flow.png
            Setting this to something above DEBUG can help when dealing with
            excessive log output.
    generate_name: Automatically generates a name for the logger based on the calling module if name is not given.
