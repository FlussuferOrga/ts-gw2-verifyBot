# ts-gw2-verifyBot
This script is intended to be used as an automatic form of Teamspeak authentication for Guild Wars 2.

# How it works:
Using the ts3 module, the bot logs into the teamspeak server by IP via the serverquery account. See teamspeak documentation on this account, password would have been generated on server creation.

Bot will sit in any specificed channel (defined in the bot.conf)and wait for commands to be sent. Currently the commands are limited, but the framework is there add custom ones yourself.

The guild wars authentication uses the API keys from user's accounts. It also requires at least 1 character on said account to be level 80 ( level is configurable in bot.conf).
